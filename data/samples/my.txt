we took the kids to the aquarium and then grabbed satay by the river; it was packed but super fun, and the sunset over the water was unreal.
the car wouldnt start in the basement car park, so I called roadside assist and they said a truck is on the way. I might be a bit late for dinner.

I am on the expressway and the GPS keeps rerouting because of an accident near the exit; expect delays if you are coming this way.

morning team, quick update from the client call. they want the onboarding flow simplified and the pricing page refreshed with the new copy.

so my flight out of KLIA got delayed again, and now I am stuck waiting near gate C12 with a lukewarm kopi. I already let the hotel know about the late check in. if the connection falls apart, I might crash at my cousins place in Cheras and catch the early train tomorrow.
hey all, thanks for coming to the BBQ yesterday. the kids had a blast, the neighbours brought way too many desserts, and someone left a blue cooler behind. if its yours, send me a text and I will drop it off tonight after work.
I am dictating this while driving, so ignore any weird spacing. the NKVE is backed up near the stadium, and I can see the exit but its barely moving. I will be late for pickup, but I am bringing pizza so the wait should be worth it.
reminder for everyone on the project: update your Jira tickets before EOD and flag anything blocked. leadership wants a clean status for the Friday review, and we need to show progress on the mobile fixes and the payment retry work.
quick story: I finally got my passport renewed after three trips to the immigration office, a photo booth at the mall, and a ton of forms. the officer was actually super helpful, but I lost half a day on it.
