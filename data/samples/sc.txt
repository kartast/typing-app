we took the kids to the museum and then grabbed fish and chips by the river; it was packed but super fun, and the sunset over the water was unreal.
the car wouldnt start in the car park, so I called roadside assist and they said a truck is on the way. I might be a bit late for dinner.
quick reminder: the building is doing a fire drill at 10 am, so if youre in the office please take your laptop and pass with you.
I just realised the reservation is for six, not eight. do we want to add two more or split into another table?
my boss asked for a one page summary on the campaign results, with highlights on click through rate and spend by channel.
the new hire starts Monday, so can someone set up their laptop, email, and access to the drive before 9 am?
I am on the motorway and the GPS keeps rerouting because of an accident near the exit; expect delays if you are coming this way.
we tried the farmers market downtown and the oatcake stall was the best; I grabbed extra in case you want to take some home.
thanks for covering the shift, I owe you one. next time pints are on me at the pub by the river.
just a heads up, the landlord is doing a quick inspection this afternoon, so I am tidying the sitting room before I head out.
the parcel from Apple says delivered but its not in the lobby. can you check the mailroom when you get a chance?
I just got off a long call with support and they said the refund will post in 3 to 5 business days.
if you are still up for it, we can hit the trail early Saturday, grab bagels, and be back before the heat kicks in.
dear team, please find below update regarding quarterly review. kindly submit status reports by Thursday EOD. CFO joining for first 30 mins so keep financial overview crisp. reach out if facing blockers. regards
so my flight out of Edinburgh got delayed again, and now I am stuck waiting near gate 11 with a lukewarm tea. I already let the hotel know about the late check in. if the connection falls apart, I might crash at my cousins place in Leith and catch the early train tomorrow.
hey all, thanks for coming to the ceilidh yesterday. the kids had a blast, the neighbours brought way too many desserts, and someone left a blue cooler behind. if its yours, send me a text and I will drop it off tonight after work.
I am dictating this while driving, so ignore any weird spacing. the motorway is backed up near the stadium, and I can see the exit but its barely moving. I will be late for pickup, but I am bringing pizza so the wait should be worth it.
reminder for everyone on the project: update your Jira tickets before EOD and flag anything blocked. leadership wants a clean status for the Friday review, and we need to show progress on the mobile fixes and the payment retry work.
quick story: I finally got my passport renewed after three trips to the post office, a photo booth at Boots, and a ton of forms. the clerk was actually super helpful, but I lost half a day on it.
just posted the new flat tour on Insta, and the view from the balcony is unreal. if you are around this weekend, swing by and we can grab brunch at the cafe downstairs.
I talked to the support rep about the double charge, and they escalated it to billing. they said the refund should land by next Tuesday, but I will keep the case open until it clears.
