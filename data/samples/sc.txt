I'll chuck it in the bin.
Aye, I'll sort the playlist.
The bairn's lost a sock again.
Fancy a wee road trip?
I'll be there in a mo.
The windae's rattlin in the wind.
Can ye grab me a paper?
I'm no sure aboot that.
Just booked the table.
The lift's oot of order.
I'll grab a taxi.
We're sittin in the back.
I'll keep ye posted.
That was a close one.
I'm due a holiday.
Let's make it a quick one.
The kitchen's a tip.
I'm chuffed ye can make it.
Nae idea where I put it.
I'll be at the door.
Just makin a brew.
The lines are busy.
I'll tidy up later.
Fancy a wee blether?
I'll drop ye a line the morn.
The haggis was magic.
I'm starvin.
I'll bring the snacks.
We're runnin late, sorry.
That shop's shut the day.
The car's in the garage.
I'll pick up the weans.
Just a sec, phone's low.
I'm away for a nap.
Let's meet after five.
The neebours are noisy.
I lost ma umbrella.
I'll make a playlist.
I'm ready when ye are.
See ye soon, pal.
