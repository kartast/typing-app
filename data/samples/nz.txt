I am dictating this while driving, so ignore any weird spacing. the motorway is backed up near the stadium, and I can see the exit but its barely moving. I will be late for pickup, but I am bringing pizza so the wait should be worth it.
reminder for everyone on the project: update your Jira tickets before EOD and flag anything blocked. leadership wants a clean status for the Friday review, and we need to show progress on the mobile fixes and the payment retry work.
